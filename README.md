# Tumor Prediction
This repository hosts several scripts I have written for my tumor prediction project. It includes python scripts for creating a file tree, converting from Entrez to Ensembl gene ID's, creating seperate TSV files, and running RIPTiDe. It also includes bash scripts to run these RIPTiDe on all generated TSV files in parallel on Rivanna, an HPC system.
