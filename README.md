#  Computer models of human metabolic networks to analyze cancer states and predict biomarkers

<!---

## Metabolic Modeling

Using constraint-based modeling (CBM) techniques, I constructed context-specific metabolic models for cancer and normal tissue.

## Flux Balance Analysis

Using FBA, I simulated metabolic fluxes in cancer and normal tissue models and identified dysregulated metabolic reactions.
